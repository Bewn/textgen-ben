this is the home of the startup script, if you run it here you will get a portable textgen directory here
you can run `source ./startup.sh` to load it in your environment, then type `package` to install it to your
computer at `/opt/textgen-portable`, you will need sudo privileges to install, but otherwise it runs entirely in userland.
